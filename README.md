# React Projects from Scrimba Tutorial

This repository contains three React projects that I built while following a tutorial on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). These projects helped me improve my React skills, though they are not perfect and can be further improved.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Programming Language Hangman**
A game inspired by Hangman but with a twist: instead of a stick figure, we "kill" a programming language each time a guessed letter is incorrect.

**Features:**
- Letter guessing functionality
- Visual representation of wrong guesses
- Game-over and restart functionality

### 2. **Tenzies Game**
A classic Tenzies dice game built using React.

**Features:**
- Roll dice until all show the same number
- Hold dice to prevent re-rolling
- Win condition detection

### 3. **AI Cooking Assistant**
A cooking assistant that takes a list of ingredients from the user and returns a recipe using AI.

**Features:**
- User inputs available ingredients
- AI suggests a recipe based on given ingredients
- Dynamic and interactive UI
